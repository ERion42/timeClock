Okay, so here's where I'm putting all my notes:

1. LOCAL STORAGE IS BAD
Local storage should be swapped for a SQL or NoSQL database ASAP. Local Storage is only being utilized so I can get the basic process running.

2. LOOK INTO SESSION STORAGE
It's not long-term, but can be used to house some of the temporary numbers needed for calculations.

3. STYLE
Yeah, I know it's not styled. I'll get there.

4. IMPROVE GUI
Gameify it. Make the user feel like they're sitting at a terminal in a Fallout or Resident Evil game.

5. ADD DATE

6. ADD DISPLAY BOARD
This might need to come with the database so I can list by descending order.

7. ADD USER COMMENT
This should be what the user is working on, project-wise
